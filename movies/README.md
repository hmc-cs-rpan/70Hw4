# Homework 3

# Overview

On knuth (and many other machines), if you accidentally type `sl` instead of `ls`, you will get a big surprise! Try it out for yourself and see what happens. This combination of ASCII art and animation is known as ASCIImation.

Over the next two assignments, you’ll have a chance to design your own ASCIImation creations. In the first part of the assignment, you will learn about working with pointers and primitive arrays.

# Reading

We suggest focusing specifically on the following sections of the *C++ Primer* textbook this week:
* Sections 3.5.1-3.5.2 for a review of primitive arrays
* Section 7.1.2 for different ways to define member functions
* Section 8.2 to better understand the file-reading code in the starter code

In addition, you may find the following class resources helpful:
* The [Wiki page on Makefiles](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2015/Admin/wiki/Makefiles) . We have given you a Makefile this week. Take a minute now to read through it and make sure that you understand how it works, because in future weeks you will be asked to create or modify your own. Once you've read it, run make on the command line to build the initial version of the program. You’ll notice that make prints the commands that it executes. You can also try running the initial version of the program, but you'll notice that it doesn’t do much right now.

# Steps
There are seven Issues to complete for this assignment:

1. Define the `Sprite` class
2. Define the `Movie` class
3. Add movie display controls
4. Create a program to display a movie
5. Set your sprite in motion
6. Create a new sprite
7. Build your first movie!

# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows: 
* 10 points: correctness
* 15 points: completeness
* 5 points: style 
* 5 points: elegance
* 5 points: clarity 
* 10 points: peer review

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2015/Admin/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories. 

The grutors will also provide written comments on your code's style and elegance.
