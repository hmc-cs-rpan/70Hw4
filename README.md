# Overview
Last week, you generated ASCII movies with scrolling, fixed-width sprites. In this assignment, you'll get a chance to make your movies more sophisticated. You'll make your movie work with any size sprite, and make it possible to have more than one sprite on the screen at a time. Along the way, you will learn some new tools (`doxygen` and `valgrind`), work with pointers and dynamic memory allocation, and gain a bit more understanding of constructors and destructors.


# Reading
Before you begin, read the “Constructors, Destructors, and Assignment” handout posted on the course website. We also suggest you keep the following references handy:
* The wiki pages on `doxygen` and `valgrind`
* Section 3.5.3 of the *C++Primer* textbook for a review of dynamically-allocated arrays
* Sections 7.1.4-7.1.5 of the *C++ Primer* textbook for a review of constructors, destructors, and assignment operators

# Steps
There are 10 issues to complete for this assignment:

1. Meet `doxygen`
1. Written Component
1. Add `make clean`
1. Add a Movie constructor
1. Add a Sprite constructor
1. Allow multiple sprites in a movie
1. Disable default constructors
1. Modify the Sprite image format
1. Dynamically allocate Sprite contents
1. Make a movie!
